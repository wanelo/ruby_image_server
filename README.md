## Testing

TODO: Add information specific to your gem's test suite.

The Rakefile comes with several convenience tasks for running tests as well. By rake task:

  + `spec`: Runs all rspec tests in the spec directory.
  + `yard`: Generates yard documentation.
  + `rubocop`: Runs rubocop.
  + `run_guards`: Runs all guards.

`run_guards` is the one you're most likely to want to run, since it runs all the other test-related tasks.
